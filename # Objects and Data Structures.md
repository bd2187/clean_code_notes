# Objects and Data Structures

-   Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.

-   Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

-   Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without
    changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add
    new classes without changing existing functions.

-   Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must
    change. OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change
